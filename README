libcaja-extension python bindings
====================================

These are unstable bindings for the caja extension library.

For examples and documentation check the examples sub directory.

As of python-caja 1.5.0, scripts are loaded only from $XDG_DATA_DIR/caja-python/extensions,
which includes ~/.local/share and /usr/share (or whatever your $XDG_DATA_DIR is 
set to).

Try to copy test.py to that directory for an example

Requirements
============

Caja      1.6.0
Python    2.7
PyGObject 2.28.0

Problems
========
It's currently not possible to reload the python file without
restarting caja. That's a planned feature for future versions.
